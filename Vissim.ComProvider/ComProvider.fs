    (*
     The TypeLib registry key allows specifying separate type libraries for platform affinity.
     However, the type provider has no way to know what target platform the subject project
     will be compiled to beforehand. Furthermore, the target platform isn't actually known until
     runtime if "Any CPU" is selected. Therefore, we have to leave this as the developer's choice
     in selecting the type library with proper platform affinity at source code level.

     If the type library is for an out-of-process COM automation server, the client application
     and server do not have to have the same CPU platform, that is, a win32 client can communicate
     with a win64 COM server. In this case, we can choose win32 or win64 type library as we like,
     while seting either "Any CPU", "x86", or "x64" as the compiling option for the client application.

     If the type library is for an in-process COM Dll, the client application and the COM Dll must
     have the same target platform. This means, if the COM Dll is 32 bit, the compiling option must
     be consistent, and must be set to x86 CPU as well.
