This tool benchmarks your workstation in terms of Vissim 2020 realtime factor. 

The higher the realtime factor, the more powerful your workstation. However, use
at your own risk and make your own judgement call. For a decent workstation
in the year 2020, a x20 realtime factor is reasonably expected for the "Turbo" mode.

This tool only supports Vissim 2020. You can modify/edit the F# source code for
other Vissim versions.
